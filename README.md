# Vision

Vision was an application that I developed in the 1st semester. What it does is it acts as an umbrella application for all other social media applications.</br>
It is an all-in-one social media app allowing users to access their accounts across platforms through a single biometric login. Benefit of the app is bi-fold â€“ takes less than 1% of phone storage compared to before and single biometric login eliminates the need to remember credentials.</br> 
Technology Used: WebBrowser. </br>
